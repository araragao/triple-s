## Why are you building this?

I have been working with Spring for ~10 months now and I felt that it was time to develop a personal project to showcase my skills.
Furthermore, I have also been wanting to get a more tangible overview of what is it like to set-up a production ready environment with all the bells and whistles that come with it: CI/CD, containerization, orchestration and secret management.

**tl;dr**: I am a (possibly not) complete noob and this is a sandbox project to improve my web related skills.

## What's the tech stack?

- `Java 17`
- `Spring Boot`

- `MongoDB`

- `Docker`
- `Docker Compose`

- `GitHub Actions`
